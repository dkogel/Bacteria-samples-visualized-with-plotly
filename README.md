# Bacteria samples visualized with Plotly

The purpose of this project was to practice using Plotly with JavaScript 
to create interactive data visualizations for websites. I used a sample dataset in JSON 
format that represents a study of the bacteria cultures in test subjects' 
belly buttons. The dashboard created displays metadata for each 
test subject, a bar chart that shows the top 10 cultures found from each subject, a gauge chart displaying wash frequency, and a bubble chart
showing all strains and their concentrations. All visualizations employed Plotly, and the charts 
update each time a new test subject ID is chosen from the drop down menu.
